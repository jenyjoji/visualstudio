        <p id="firstp"> Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs,
             as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps.</p>
        
        <p id="secondp"> A console is the combination of a monitor and keyboard. It is a rudimentary interface in which the monitor provides the 
            output and the keyboard is used for input. While any computer with a monitor and keyboard may be considered a console,
             the term most often refers to a system used to control one or more servers.</p>
